Application of XAI techniques to identificate the knowledge get by a neural network trained to identify different types of malicious traffic.

The Jupiter notebooks with the termination V2. contain the code to implement SHAP over a problem of two kinds of traffic: benign and attack. On the other hand, if file's termination is V3. the problem had seven diferent traffics from the public database CIC-CSE-IDS2018.
